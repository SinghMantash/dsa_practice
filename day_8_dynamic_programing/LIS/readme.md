# Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [300,9,2,5,3,7,500,400]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,500], 
therefore the length is 4.
