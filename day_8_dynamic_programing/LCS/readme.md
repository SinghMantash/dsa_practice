# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

## Problem Description

The task is to find the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two given strings, `text1` and `text2`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

### Example:

#### Input:
```text
text1 = "pbcdq"
text2 = "pcq"
```


#### Output:
```text
3
```

#### Explanation:
```text
The longest common subsequence between text1 and text2 is "pcq", and its length is 3.
```
