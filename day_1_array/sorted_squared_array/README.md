# Sorted Squared Array

## Problem Description

You are given an array of integers where each subsequent value is not less than the previous value (i.e., the array is sorted in non-decreasing order). Your task is to write a function that takes this array as input and returns a new array where each element is the square of the corresponding element from the input array, and the result is sorted in ascending order.

## Example 1

Input: -2,0,3,5
Expected Output: 0,4,9,25


## Example 2

Input: -5,-3,-1,0,2,4
Expected Output: 0,1,4,9,16,25
