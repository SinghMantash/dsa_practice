# Partition Equal Subset Sum

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if you can partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal, or `false` otherwise.

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```javascript
nums = [1, 5, 20, 14]
```

**Output:**
```javascript
true
```

**Explanation:**

The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 14] and [20], where both subsets have the sum of 20.
