# Permutations 2 (Handling Duplicates)

## Problem Statement

Given a collection of numbers, `nums`, that might contain duplicates, the task is to return all possible **unique permutations** of the numbers in any order. Since the input array can contain duplicate values, the solution must ensure that the same permutation is not included multiple times.

### Input
- An array `nums` containing integers, which may include duplicates.

### Output
- An array of arrays containing all unique permutations of `nums`. The output should not contain duplicate permutations.

## **Example 1:**

### **Input:**
```javascript
nums = [3, 3, 2]
```

### **Output**
```javascript
[[3, 3, 2], [3, 2, 3], [2, 3, 3]]
```
