# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! 🎉

This repo is created with the aim to provide a public, open space for anyone who wants to learn, improve, or practice DSA. I will be continuously adding various problems, solutions, and resources to help fellow learners and developers enhance their problem-solving skills.

### 📚 Contents

- **Algorithms**: Solutions to common algorithms such as sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.
- **Problem Solving**: Solutions to problems from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, and HackerRank.
- **Resources**: Links to books, tutorials, and articles that have helped me along the way.

### 💡 Why This Repo Exists

Data Structures and Algorithms form the backbone of software engineering interviews and are a critical skill for any developer. By sharing my practice here, I hope to build a collaborative environment where anyone can:

- Learn from various problem-solving approaches.
- Improve their coding skills.
- Contribute solutions and resources to help others.
- Prepare for competitive programming or interviews.

### 🏆 Goals for this Repo

- Build a community of learners and problem-solvers.
- Improve the repository with diverse and optimal solutions.
- Organize problems by data structure and algorithm type for easy learning.
